  [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/).

v0.6.0
------

A considerable amount of refactoring occurred for this build, chiefly to get
rid of Python 2.7 support. While the functionality did not change much for this
version, we have switched from a `pkgutil`-style `pydrobert` namespace to
PEP-420-style namespaces. As a result, *this package is not
backwards-compatible with previous `pydrobert` packages!* Make sure that if
any of the following are installed, they exceed the following version
thresholds:

- `pydrobert-param >0.2.0`
- `pydrobert-pytorch >0.2.1`
- `pydrobert-speech >0.1.0`

Miscellaneous other changes include:

- Type hints everywhere
- Shifted python source to `src/`, alongside Kaldi source
- Updated numpy swig bindings for numpy 1.11.3
- Black-formatted remaining source
- Removed `future` and `six`, `configparser`
- Shifted a lot of the configuration to `setup.cfg`. There is still
  considerable work in `setup.py` due to the C extension
- Shifted documentation source from `doc/` to `docs/`
- Shuffled around the indexing of documentation
- Added changelog :D
