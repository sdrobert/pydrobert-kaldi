    Notes
    -----
    The "base float" mentioned in this documentation is the same type as
    ``kaldi::BaseFloat``, which was determined when Kaldi was built. The
    easiest way to determine whether this is a double (64-bit) or a
    float (32-bit) is by checking the value of
    ``KaldiDataType.BaseVector.is_double()``.
